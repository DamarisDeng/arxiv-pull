    "abstract": "We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model that integrates single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data to infer gene regulatory networks. Our approach uses a spike-and-slab prior on network edges and employs variational inference for scalable posterior approximation. Benchmarking on simulated and real datasets from mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrates superior accuracy over existing methods, particularly for identifying weak regulatory interactions.",

Using a piecewise-deterministic Markov process framework, we derive analytical expressions for the time-dependent mRNA distribution and validate predictions against live-cell imaging data from Drosophila.",

Applied to yeast two-hybrid datasets, our method achieves 15% improvement in AUROC over static GNN baselines for predicting transient interactions.",
